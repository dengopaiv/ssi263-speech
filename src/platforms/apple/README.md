# SSI-263 Speech for macOS and iOS (in progress)

A system speech voice for VoiceOver and every app on the Mac, iPhone and iPad, speaking with the same emulated
SSI-263 hardware as the NVDA add-ons, the SAPI engine, the Linux module and the Android app, with the same PCM for
the same text and settings. The Android app is the blueprint (`src/platforms/android`), and TGSpeechBox's Apple app
is the model for the Xcode project, the speech extension and its VoiceOver pauses.

The apps ship hollow: no firmware at all, only this project's own MIT code and MAME's BSD-3-Clause cores. Each user
imports the firmware they own, recognised by content (SHA-256), never by name.

## Voices and languages

Ten voices, each speaking one language, offered to the system only once their firmware is imported: the Braille
Lite 2000 in English, Spanish, German and Italian, the Slovak Braille 'n Speak 2000, the Speak-Out, the Mockingboard
(1.1 and early) and the two Accents. Then the Braille Lite 2000's language updates: one voice per language the
release table names a voice for (`src/csrc/blazie/bl_languages.txt`: Hungarian, Turkish, Polish and 14 more), read
from the library (`blv_release_*`, `ssa_release_voice`), never listed in Swift. Each is offered under the system's
own locale for its language (hu-HU; Arabic as ar-001, Norwegian as nb-NO, Portuguese as pt-PT beside Brazil's
pt-BR), and named in English ("Braille Lite 2000 (Russian)", the table's `vname`). The Setup list shows each
voice's file (`BL2HUN.BNS — not imported`); the languages wait behind "Show all Braille Lite importable languages (17,
N imported)", imported or not. One import takes them all from the NVDA add-on too (`_ssi263_blazie/bl2000/`). A release no voice speaks yet (the betas, Japanese) is still
imported, kept under `units/` for the Braille Lite unit tab. Last, after the release voices so no voice before it
moves (`ssa_engine.h`'s `SSA_SOUNDINGBOARD`, 27 of 28): GW Micro's Sounding Board, the Speak-Out's voice on the
card's own DOS drivers (`src/csrc/soundingboard`, on the Accent-mini's pc86), imported from `sb.zip`, from the 0.8.5
add-on (`_ssi263_speakout/`, beside the Speak-Out's HEX) or as its `SBLOAD.COM` and `SB.COM` chosen together (several
loose files are judged as one source): the voice needs both, so one alone is refused with why. It is always shown in
the firmware list, and takes the Speak-Out's settings. Languages work as in TGSpeechBox's speech extension, with Android's one locale
per voice: the units have no dialect firmware, so the English voices are en-US only and the Spanish Braille Lite es-ES
only (0.8's first builds also offered en-GB, en-AU, en-CA and es-MX copies; their identifiers still name the voice). The locale ends the voice's identifier (`com.ssi263speech.braillelite.de-de`), and VoiceOver switches language
by choosing another voice for the next request. `<lang>` elements inside a request are not switched on. "Lock
language" (Voice settings) speaks every request with the voice chosen in the app, whatever the request names, for
readers that always ask for the system's language.

## The app's pages, as Android's

Setup and Voice settings follow the Android app's pages and words (`SettingsActivity.kt`), with VoiceOver in place of
TalkBack and nothing built in. Setup: the voices, the firmware list (file names, the languages under "Show all"), the
import (a line per unit in the confirmation: how long it takes, and whether it replaces one already here; the device
kept awake while it runs; refused below 16 MB free), "Try it" (with Android's "Export to WAV…": the preview's render written where the person chooses -- the save
panel on the Mac, the file exporter on iOS -- named by `WavExport.swift` as Android's `WavExport.kt` names it,
`speakout-20261018-164533.wav`, `braillelite-de-...`; a Stop during the render, or a cancelled or failed write, leaves
no file), where to choose the voice, the licences. On the Mac, `say` sees the voices too: `say -v "Speak-Out (en-US)"
-o hello.aiff "Hello there."` (or `--file-format=WAVE`) writes the same voice to a file. Voice settings:
the voice and Lock language, rate, pitch, tone, engine volume (135 percent by default), the unit's settings (inflection,
short pauses, numbers, run ahead, line lift, the idle sound, the sample rate), the Speak-Out's, and VoiceOver's pauses.
Left out on purpose: Android's built-in Accent SA and Mockingboards (the app carries no firmware), its update check (the
App Store's), and 44 kHz (the Audio Unit runs at 22050).

## The Braille Lite unit tab

The app's third tab runs a Blazie unit on the firmware already imported for the voices: one app, no second firmware
picker (PR 18's standalone emulator was declined for that). Its units are the emulator's own catalog (`emc_list`,
src/apps/blazie/emu_catalog.c, the list every emulator shell reads) over the unit folder: the shipped units under
their flat names and every release on the table by its content, `units/` included -- never a unit without its
firmware. A release unit's first start makes its state by its own recipe (`emc_make_factory`). Each unit's memory is
the app's own (Application Support, "Braille Lite units"), saved when it is switched off or the app is left; the
voices' states in the App Group are only read. The unit runs in real time (`emu_unit.h`: its sound pulled by the
audio engine, its keys pushed as they go down and up through `chords.c`, as the Windows shell). Its braille field is
the Windows and GTK pattern: one read-only element holding the display as Unicode braille, keeping the keyboard (F D
S J K L, the space bar, ; and A the bars, by the keys' places), Alt+Shift+Right and Left the display's bars held.
Whether VoiceOver sends the field to braille alone, and whether its keys reach the unit, are for the testers.

One unit runs at a time: while it runs the unit choice is dimmed and "Switch off" is the only way to another.
"Load programs and files into flash" is the Windows and GTK shells' (`UnitFiles.swift`, on `bl_files_xfer.h`'s
`blx_add_cp`): the unit switched off and saved, the files (.bns, .bas, .txt, .brl, .brf, or any) added to its flash
startup folder in one batch, names it has already replaced only when the person says so, the memory as it was kept as
`<state>.before-import`, the unit switched on again. The Sound section has the GTK shell's idle channel (as the unit,
hiss, whine, silent), how long the channel stays open (off, until the unit clicks off, always), the pop and click, and
the 10 Hz tick (`emu_set_idle`), with its defaults.

While a unit runs, "Restart the unit (keeps its files)" switches it off and on as a real unit: saved (`emu_save`,
which never asks the firmware, so a unit that stopped answering is saved too) and started again from what it saved,
with the tab's settings applied again -- never the factory reset. "Restart in one-handed mode (dot 6 held as it
starts)" and "... two-handed mode (dot 3 held as it starts)" are that restart with the key held for the unit's first
2 s (`emu_hold_at_start`, set before its first render): the firmware says "One-hand mode on" and keeps the mode in its
memory. They are not offered for the Type 'n Speak, whose manual has no such mode. "Double-speed upgrade installed"
(off by default, `emu_set_double_speed`, applied at every start and at once) is Blazie's $99 chip: the unit's own
switch (the status menu, then + (dots 3-4-6), answered y) then doubles its CPU, and BASIC's tones can garble and games
freeze as on a real unit (the latch race), which Restart gets out of.

## The native core: SSI263Core

`build_apple.sh` builds the chip, every voice's board, host and voice on MAME's Z180, 8085, V40 and 8086 cores (C++17
interpreters with no JIT, which iOS allows), the voice table (`src/csrc/voices.c`), Android's plain-C front end
(`ssa_engine`, `ssa_map` and `ssa_import`, used unchanged) and the Apple front end's own C (`core/`). These are the
same sources and flags as `build_android.sh`, with `-ffp-contract=off` throughout so the arithmetic is the reference's.
It makes static libraries for each Apple platform:

| Platform | Architectures | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | arm64, x86_64 | 13.0 |
| iOS (devices) | arm64 | 16.0 |
| iOS Simulator | arm64, x86_64 | 16.0 |

    sh src/platforms/apple/build_apple.sh              every slice, then build/apple/SSI263Core.xcframework
    sh src/platforms/apple/build_apple.sh macos        one platform only

The output goes under `build/apple/` (gitignored). The apps link it with `-lc++`.

## TestFlight

    python src/platforms/apple/testflight.py build [--bump]      archives for macOS and iOS, made fresh and checked
    python src/platforms/apple/testflight.py upload              exactly those, then processed, for the internal group
    python src/platforms/apple/testflight.py status | crashes

This is TGSpeechBox's `testflight.py`, with its rules kept. The build number is the same on both platforms
(`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `project.yml`, and the Audio Unit's version with it), raised by one for each upload. A
failed-looking upload is never retried before `status` shows what arrived. What goes up is the archive `build` checked:
its build numbers, its icon and privacy manifests, and `test/check_archive_no_firmware.py`, which makes sure it
carries no firmware at all (Android's checks, plus Aicom's files). The icon is drawn by `tools/make_icon.swift`
(`tools/make_icon.sh` adds the Mac sizes).

`test_apple_core.py` links Android's host-side program (`test_android_native.c`) against each runnable slice's
`libssi263core.a`, the library the apps link, and requires every case's samples and PCM hash to be the desktop
program's, along with the Accent SA's front-end text. `test_android_native.py` holds that desktop program to the
references, so the slices are held to them too. It runs macOS arm64 natively, x86_64 under Rosetta, and, with
`--simulator`, the iOS Simulator's arm64 in a booted simulator (`xcrun simctl spawn`). The device slice is checked
on the device by the app. Its control runs the slices with the request's rate dropped (`ssa_map_break`), so the run
must fail.

`test_apple_speech.py` holds the Apple front end's own C to its rules, on the macos-arm64 slice:
- **SSML:** VoiceOver's SSML is parsed as TGSpeechBox's speech extension parses it. The cases cover iOS 27's `<s>`
  parts, an `800.0ms` break folding into the sentence end before it, the strengths, the 30 ms floor, the 2 s cap, the
  end-of-request pause, a break-only spacer, the entities, the rate, and the volume rotor's decibels.
- **Speaking:** every voice whose files are there speaks each request byte for byte as its segments through
  `ssa_start`/`ssa_pull` directly, with the pauses' zeros between them. A stop holds, and off, short and long differ
  in length.
- **Import:** each of Aicom's files is known by its sha256 under any name, but not with one byte changed; a release
  with no shipped voice (a release voice's, and one no voice speaks) comes back as `SSP_FW_RELEASE` plus its row.
- **The release voices:** every one whose firmware is in the firmware folder (`release_voices.py`: found by content,
  its state made once by the desktop library and kept in `build/apple/test/release-states` only while its sha256 is
  the table's) speaks each request as every voice does.

`run_swift_tests.sh` compiles the app's import (`FirmwareImport.swift`, `ZipReader.swift`) with
`FirmwareImportTests.swift`: every case of Android's `FirmwareImportTest.kt` (the zip layouts, the add-on, update
programs, only the releases on the list, never a state, the Speak-Out's HEX, the words), the Accents' files (the
Accent add-on's `accent-sa/` ROMs and driver, loose and renamed), each zip form the reader takes (stored, deflated,
the sizes in a data descriptor), and zips made by `ditto` (Finder's Compress), Info-ZIP's `zip` and Python's
`zipfile`.

On the Mac, `test_android_native.py` runs every block but the Accent SA's, whose reference is the NVDA driver on the
Windows DLLs: `SSI263_ANDROID_TEST_ONLY=bl,ra,num,so,mini,import`.
