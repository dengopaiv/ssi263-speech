/* ssa_import.h -- the Speak-Out's firmware and the Mockingboard's (below), as a user brings them.  The Speak-Out's:
 * GW Micro's SPEAKOUT.HEX, judged by its content -- the Intel HEX format, then the known firmware's sha256
 * (firmware/gw-micro-speakout/README.txt's, the one nvda/build_speakout.py builds the add-on from and
 * check_apk_no_firmware.py keeps out of the APK) -- never by its name.  The Braille Lite's is bl_firmware.h's;
 * ssa_import_firmware asks that one first and these when it finds none.
 *
 * The app never carries the Speak-Out's file, and carries the Mockingboard's only as its built-in copies (below):
 * the user imports them (FirmwareImport.kt, SsiImport.kt).  Plain C, no JNI: the
 * host-side test (src/platforms/android/test) compiles it too.  MIT.
