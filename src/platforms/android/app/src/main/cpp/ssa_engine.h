 * 0.8's three Blazie units -- Blazie's September 2000 German and Italian Braille Lite 2000, the Slovak Braille 'n
 * Speak 2000 -- under the NVDA add-on's flat names for their files, as sd_voices.c has them (the German and Italian
 * update disks both call theirs Lite2000.BNS).  voices.c gives each its code page (850; the Slovak unit's 852), lets
 * the Italian and Slovak units end without ^F echoes, and drops the number words and run ahead for all three (they
 * read their own numbers; run ahead is tested on English and Spanish alone).
 *
 * The Aicom Accent SA (the built-in voice, Tomi 2026-09-30: Aicom's ROMs ship in the APK, handed over in memory) runs
 * through as_voice.h, the NVDA Accent driver's front end in C.  Each utterance gets a unit of its own, booted as the
 * driver boots one and let go afterwards: so an utterance sounds the same whatever came before it (a capital's raised
 * pitch cannot linger, and a stop needs no flush), and every pitch -- the app's slider and the request's together --
 * is said the way the driver says a capital's, with snap_pitch, so it jumps rather than glides from the unit's
 * power-up pitch.  The next unit is booted as soon as one is let go.
 *
 * The other voices keep one unit each, booted on first use, as the speech-dispatcher module keeps them: the settings
 * sent before each utterance, the audio pulled block by block, a stop between blocks, and a cancel so the next
 * utterance starts clean.  The Speak-Out and the Accent-mini take a request's pitch as the NVDA driver takes a
 * capital's -- the slider's pitch as the setting, the difference as PitchCommand's offset (snapped to, and restored
 * after the utterance by the voice itself) -- moved at least one of the box's pitch steps, as the Accent SA's is.
 * The Mockingboard takes it the same way (its inflection's steps, mbv_pitch_step), and from the settings its number
 * words, as the Braille Lite does.
 * The Braille Lite takes it as its pitch setting (bl_voice's own scale has 32 steps), and from the settings its
 * number words (the NVDA driver's "Custom number processing", bl_numbers through blv_set_numbers: on by default, as
 * there) and its experimental run ahead (blv_set_run_ahead).
 *
 * No JNI here (ssa_jni.c is the thin bridge), so the host-side test (src/platforms/android/test) runs this same code
 * on the desktop and over adb.  Not thread-safe: one caller at a time (the app holds a lock), except ssa_stop.
