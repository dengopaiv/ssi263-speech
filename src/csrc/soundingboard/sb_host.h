/* sb_host.h -- GW Micro's Sounding Board in C: src/hosts/soundingboard.py, line for line, on MAME's 8086 (../pc86).
 * The card's own DOS drivers, version 2.7 -- SBLOAD.COM ("Text-To-Speech in DOS": the rules) and SB.COM (the card
 * driver), both packed .COM files that unpack themselves -- loaded as DOS would, each until it stays resident, in a bare
 * PC that stands in for DOS and the BIOS: the card's SSI-263 at 300h-304h with A/R on IRQ2 (vector 0Ah), a BIOS timer
 * (SB.COM waits for 18 ticks at start-up), and text in as a screen reader sent it, INT 17h to LPT3.  The drivers'
 * front end is the Speak-Out's, byte for byte (tools/check_soundingboard.py), so the Speak-Out's voice (so_voice.h)
 * drives this host as it drives so_host.h: the same calls, sbh_ for soh_.
 *
 * Where it differs from soundingboard.py, on purpose, so the voice sees one behaviour: say() counts text starting with
 * ^E (a setting) as no speech, as so_host.h does; and boot() waits until the card's own greeting ("Sounding board
 * version 2.7") has played out, silently, whatever `seconds` asks (up to SBH_GREETING_LIMIT).
 *
 * Only version 2.7 is known to work (input_pending reads SB.COM's frame ring at its offsets 14Ch/14Eh): the app imports
 * only the two files by sha256.  The drivers come from the caller and are never built in.  cpu_ips 5,000,000 is the
 * Python host's coupling of instructions to chip time, not a clock.  Not thread-safe per instance.  MIT.
