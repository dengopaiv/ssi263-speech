/* bl_voice.h -- the Braille Lite as a voice: nvda/blazie/synthDrivers/blazie.py's front end in C, line for line
 * (its boot, _clean, _lines, the unit's rate/pitch/tone commands, the speak loop with the lead trim and PCM, and
 * cancel), around the C host (bl_host.h) and a chip made from the built-in defaults (ssi263_default_params).
 *
 * For front ends without Python: the Linux speech-dispatcher module, Android.  nvda/tools/voice_equiv.py gates it:
 * the real NVDA driver's PCM and this one's, byte for byte, on the same text and settings.
 *
 * The driver's number words (its "Custom number processing") come in through blv_set_numbers (bl_numbers.h), off
 * until set: without them the firmware reads numbers itself up to 999,999,999,999.  Pitch commands inside an
 * utterance (capitals) are not part of this API.
