/* bl_firmware.h -- the Braille Lite firmware a user brings, found by its content and written the way bl_create reads
 * it: a .BNS, the ROM image from file offset 3000h.
 *
 * The image starts F3 C3 xx xx FF "COPYRIGHT" (di; jp ...; then Blazie's notice).  A .BNS update file carries it at
 * 3000h (the 1998 ones at 4000h or 5000h); an update program may carry it anywhere, so the whole file is scanned.
 * Only the releases on the list (bl_firmware.c's KNOWN, by the sha256 of their image) are accepted, each one booted
 * and heard through its state recipe before it was listed (Tomi, 2026-09-30): another image -- another country's
 * release, whose addressing may differ -- is refused, never guessed at.  Blazie's other units (Braille 'n Speak, Type
 * 'n Speak, the Braille Lite 18 and 40) carry the same notice and are refused: by bl_create's firmware sites, and the
 * Braille 'n Speak 2000 (which bl_create runs, for the emulator) by bl_model.  Only hashes are here, never bytes.
