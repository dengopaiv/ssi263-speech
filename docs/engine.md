# SSI-263 chip engine, v0.18

Paths on this page are relative to `src/`, except `tools/`, which sits at the repository root. Run the tools from the root. How the engine got here, and who found what, is in [history.md](history.md).

This is a sound-generating model of the SSI-263 chip, built from its documented architecture. **It is not a verified recreation.** v0 exists to put the whole pipeline in place: registers → controller → switched-capacitor vocal tract → output stage → WAV. That lets each part be measured against the Braille Lite recordings and replaced.

The chip knows phoneme codes and register values, never words. Front ends drive it through `ssi263/drivers.py` (the data book's register streams and the MASTER lines) and through the four firmware hosts in `hosts/` ([front-ends.md](front-ends.md)).

## Since v0.5 (details: `HOLDOUT.md` and [history.md](history.md))

- **v0.6:** per-path noise glides.
- **v0.7:** stop order. The tract closes, then the stop's own noise waits for the release.
- **v0.8:** only b01 = 1 stops release; the HVC and HFC holds stay shut.
- **v0.9:** amplitude glide ×6.
- **v0.10:**
  - release 1.25 frames before the end, then a 0.3-frame burst decaying to 0.3 of FA (`tools/burst_tail.py`);
  - closure timing scaled to the phoneme's length, so a 2-frame D′2 closes as it does on the unit (`tools/closure_check.py`);
  - the Speak-Out host steps at 0.5 ms (`tools/speakout_timing.py`);
  - tag and note corrections from Astra's Reply 27.
- **v0.11:** a b01 stop releases early only when the next phoneme is open (a vowel, R, L, W, M, N): `release_lookahead`, with the held stop's noise as its burst at the next load (`late_release_burst`). The extra soft G in "program" and the "d" before the J in "manager" went away. How the chip could know the next phoneme is not established; the model's device is an early A/R with the host's writes held to the stop's end (see Astra's Reply 28 for a load-triggered alternative).
- **v0.12:** a closure that loads onto silence closes at once (`closure_onto_silence`). The one-frame delay voiced B and D after every pause; on the unit that first frame is silent (`tools/stop_after_pause.py`).
- **v0.13:** F1 glides 2.25 times as fast; the voice source is 0.8 of the old impulse plus 0.2 of MAME's SC-01 stepped glottal wave; the Braille Lite add-on adds a gentle 5 kHz roll-off after the chip, matching the unit's line out (where that roll-off comes from isn't traced).
- **v0.14:** in Z, J, V and voiced TH the noise swells with each voice pulse.
- **v0.15 (0.7.6), the hard G (`hold_release`):** since 0.6.0 the K of the firmwares' G (K HVC on the Braille Lite, KV HVC on the Speak-Out) was held and HVC's gate stayed shut, so "guess" said "ess". Now an HVC after K or KV (the firmware's PA prime between them or not) asks early for the next phoneme through `release_lookahead`'s machinery, and opens its gate `hold_release_frames` (0.5) before its end with its own `hold_release_ramp_ms` (2 ms) ramp, only when the held writes load an open phoneme. Before D, PA, a fricative or a pause, or with no answer in time, it stays shut as before. Only holds of at least `hold_release_min_frames` (2) frames qualify -- 4 - DR, or 1 in mode 1 -- so the Accents' one-frame KV KV HVC′3 HF keeps 0.7.5's output exactly: the bounded scope of this modelled fix, not a duration rule found in the silicon (Astra, Reply 151). A power-down ends the K/KV context and any hold state, after the held writes land. HVC's body, noise and timing are unchanged; `releases` (the b01 stops' delay, noise and burst) is untouched. Chosen by ear (Tomi's "C_050_sharp", Astra's Replies 146-150), not traced: a modelled rule. The firmware's write values are unchanged; with the early A/R, the writes it held land together at HVC's end, so the PA prime's ~0.66 ms is gone and what follows comes that much earlier, as after every b01 stop. `tools/check_hard_g.py` watches the gate in the chip's state; `hold_release` False is the 0.7.5 engine, bit for bit.
- **0.8, the BASIC tones (`mode1_rate15_formants`):** the Braille Lite's BASIC Sound command plays each note as M in mode 1 at speech rate 15 (articulation 0), with PA between notes. Through 0.7 the formants glided into M at every start, a bright burst the real chip does not make (Jayson heard it as a crackle in chime.bas; on Tomi's unit the starts carry +0.2 to +0.5 dB of 3-10 kHz over the steady note, ours +7 to +8). Now, in mode 1 at rate 15 only, a sounding phoneme's formants (F1 F2 F3 NAS) land at once, and PA holds the tract until the VA and FA latches are both zero, then retunes (`pa_wait`). Retuning PA at once (`immediate`, Astra's preview C) cleaned the starts but put a click at every note's end while M was still fading (Tomi's ear; +5 to +12 dB). Tomi on CHIME and Pinball with `pa_wait`: "sounds perfect" (2026-10-11; Astra, Replies 177-179). A bounded behavioural rule, not a traced gate: the real chip's rate-14 and slower transitions stay bright (50-190 ms), so nothing else changes, and the firmwares' speech runs in mode 3. `slew` is the 0.7 engine, bit for bit. `tools/check_tone_tract.py` watches the tract in the chip's state and the sound.
- **v0.16, F1 from the real chip:** Tomi played register programs on his own SSI-263: ROM vowel pairs that differ only in the F1 code. F1's rule (`f1_K`, `f1_C0`) and its bandwidth (`bw_ratio[0]`) were fitted to one pair, E/AY, and then predicted the second pair, AI/:A, and the older session's vowels below 1 kHz. Exactly those three values changed, tagged REG. It is acoustic evidence for the F1 rule, not a die trace (what PAR drives is still open). Still off: M, N and NG fit in shape but sit 3-6 dB low below 1 kHz.
- **v0.17, the noise path (`noise_path` 'own'):** the noise runs through F2..F5 sections of its own, beside the voice's cascade, which takes no noise; the two are summed before the output high-pass. The voice is v0.16's, sample for sample, and `shared` is v0.16 unchanged. Tomi heard fricatives come closer ("judges" regains its grit on the Speak-Out; the Accent unchanged). The measured noise shapes improved; some levels are still too quiet (F, TH, Z). A model construction, not an identified circuit.
- **v0.18, the BASIC tones (`mode1_rate15_formants` 'pa_slew'):** as `pa_wait`, but once the VA and FA latches reach zero, the formants slew to PA's instead of retuning at once, which removed a faint click at the ends of the Pinball lesson's notes (Tomi's ear). Mode 1 at rate 15 only; `pa_wait` is v0.17. Not a traced circuit.

## The C core

`chip.py` stays the reference: research, tuning and review happen there.
`csrc/ssi263.c` runs the same model in C99, with parameters and the ROM reading passed in
from `params.py` and `rom.py`. The NVDA add-ons run it, and it is the layer a SAPI or Linux
front end would sit on, as with the pcf8200 library.

`tools/check_native_core.py` holds the two together. It runs seeded random host sessions
(every register, power and mode changes, run, run_until_request, skip, snap_pitch) under the
defaults and under each parameter switch flipped. After every operation:
- A/R, chip time and every counter must be equal, exactly;
- audio must agree within 1e-9 (measured: 4e-15);
- the PCM must be identical.

Speed on the old NVDA's Python (3.7, 32-bit) is 15x realtime for the Speak-Out session and
12x for the Braille Lite one, against 2.7x and 2.2x with the Python chip. Build:
`python csrc/build_native.py`, which uses w64devkit, statically: the DLLs import only
KERNEL32 and msvcrt.

Run the tools with 64-bit Python, numpy, scipy and soundfile:

```
python tools/make_rom_bits.py
python tools/render.py
python tools/compare_dev.py --lines 60 [--set name=value ...]
```

## What the model does

- **Filter clock.** The vocal tract runs as a discrete-time system at fc = XCK / (2 (256 − FF)). The coefficients depend only on capacitor ratios, so FF changes the tract's sample rate and nothing else. Every resonance therefore scales exactly with the tone setting, as measured on the unit.
- **Formant sections.** F1, F2 and F3 follow one shared rule, with binary-weighted capacitor arrays: (2 sin(π f / fc))² = K (C0 + Σ wᵢbᵢ). That is two numbers per filter, not a table per phoneme.
  - The rule was fitted on development repetitions at tone 13. It predicts the same-condition held-out repetitions (H2) to 21 / 52 / 65 cents RMS (F3 / F2 / F1).
  - Those are the same words at the same settings, so this tests measurement stability, not generalisation. f ∝ fc is built into the structure; the real generalisation test is H3 (tone 19), not yet run.
  - With the bit weights left free, F2 and F3 come out close to 1, 2, 4, 8, which is independent support for the candidate bit order.
  - F1's lowest bit, the PAR row, comes out near 0. That question is open (message §26.3).
  - Since v0.16, F1's K, C0 and bandwidth come from controlled F1-only vowel pairs on the real chip (see above). That fits the rule acoustically; it doesn't trace PAR on the die.
- **Analog latches.** The sections see 4-bit latched codes, while the internal transition counters move linearly (fully internal linear transitioning, per the A data sheet).
- **Transitions run on the frame clock (v0.2), 4.0 codes per frame at articulation 5 (provisional).** `tools/transition_speed.py` v2 (ramp fit, no cap, synthetic self-test within 8 %) gives these R/ER → E1 10–90 % times, unit against engine:

  | Word | Rate 2 | Rate 10 | Rate 14 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | berry | 115 / 141 ms | 38 / 42 ms | 13 / 10 ms |
  | very | 118 / 109 ms | 48 / 35 ms | 18 / 10 ms |

  - The unit's times scale roughly with (16 − R).
  - Other articulation settings are guesses.
  - v0.1 used a fixed 20 ms and stepped audibly; Tomi heard a wobble.
- **Amplitude glides (v0.5, v0.9).** VA and FA glide 6× faster than formants. This is a fitted global slew, not an identified 6:1 clock.
  - v0.5 set 3×, the SC-01's tick ratio. At 1× the S noise ran 116 ms into the next vowel (`tools/noise_decay.py`); Tomi heard it as "extra breath underneath" the T. At 3× the tail is 16 ms.
  - v0.9 raised it to 6×, from the T and P burst width (`tools/stop_profile.py`): the unit's burst lasts about one frame, and 3× left about two, Tomi's "thick" T.
- **Host interface (v0.4).**
  - Output is block-size invariant: a pending held sample carries over between calls.
  - `request` means A/R is asserted (the pin is active-low). It is gated by power and mode; mode 0 never requests.
  - `write()` takes RS2..RS0, and addresses 4–7 select R4.
- **Timing.** Frame = 4096 (16 − R) / XCK, and phoneme = frame × (4 − DR), per the A data sheet. A/R rises at the end of each phoneme.
- **Inflection.** F0 = XCK / (8 (4096 − I)). The glide is linear in period at the measured Braille Lite rates, which scale with 1/(16 − R).
- **Noise path (v0.3).** Noise goes through a band-pass shaper (0.28 × fc), then into F2 and/or F5 (ISSCC, Fig. 1). ROM bit b02 chooses the injection point, a hypothesis supported by the audio:
  - b02 = 0 (exactly S, Z, TH, THV and T) goes to F5 only;
  - every other noise phoneme goes to F2 plus 0.25 of F5.
  
  On dev lines, S's spectral centroid is now 5.91 kHz, against 5.95 kHz on the unit. v0.2 put S near 2.6 kHz, and Tomi heard "shix" for "six".

  Since v0.17 the noise has F2..F5 sections of its own rather than entering the voice's, with its own F2/F5 weights per noise class and its own levels (see above).
- **Output stage.** High-pass with volume, then a closure ramp, then S/H at fc, then area sampling and an anti-alias FIR to the host rate.
- **The carrier.** An fc/8 line (plus fc/4) is present whenever the chip is powered, and does not follow volume, as measured.

## Hosts: firmware that drives the chip (`hosts/`)

Firmware is never stored here; each host reads the user's own file.

**`hosts/speakout.py`** runs the Speak-Out's 1995 NEC V40 firmware under Unicorn. You pass the path to your own `SPEAKOUT.HEX`.
- The host provides the V40's interrupt controller (ports 8–9) and serial unit (ports 0–3).
- The SSI-263 sits at F000:FE00–FE04, and the chip's A/R feeds the firmware's INT 0Ch.
- Text goes in with `say()`; the audio comes from this engine.
- The firmware boots, resets the chip, speaks its own greeting, then speaks any text it is given.
- XCK is 1 MHz, so its default tone register E4 gives fc = 17.9 kHz.
- **Checked against a real Speak-Out recording** (H4, `HOLDOUT.md`). The words are identical, F0 is 88.72 against 88.78 Hz (confirming 1 MHz to 0.07 %), and Tomi hears "the exact tone of the speakout".

## Development comparison (60 lines; `investigation/out/compare_dev_v0.3.txt`)

**Vowels** sit within 0–3 dB of the real unit, relative to each line's loudest phoneme. **So do most consonants** since v0.2 and v0.3: SCH, HF, Z, J, F, D′2, M and N are within about 4 dB.

Still off, engine minus real in dB:

| Phoneme | Difference |
|---|---|
| S | +7 (1 token) |
| B | +5.5 |
| K | −6.5 |
| T | −7.5 |
| P | −11 |
| THV′1 | −10 |
| V′1 | −6.5 |
| HVC | −21 |

Most of these involve the unfinished closure.

- **Closure (v0.4).** The delay is 2 frames, and consecutive closure phonemes stay shut, so the tract does not reopen.
  - Stops after non-stops sit within about 4 dB of the unit.
  - K → HVC, the hard g, is silent on the unit, as here.
  - D′2 → D′2 is −16 dB on the unit; here it is silent.
  - K → T and P → T ("act", "kept") are untested on the unit.
- **Spectrum.** In the speech bands the engine is 6 dB short at 100–300 Hz and 5 dB over at 3.5–4.5 kHz.
  - The overall spectrum above about 5 kHz is dominated by vowels, and there it sits near the line-in floor.
  - Fricative segments on their own do carry real energy at 6–9 kHz, and bursts up to 14 kHz. See `investigation/out/fricative_spectra_v0.3.txt`.
- **The capture path is not modelled yet.** The real side includes the Braille Lite's output path, which must go in a separate stage, not into the chip. The tone ladder (tones 1, 7, 13, 25) is what separates the two: chip features move with fc, the output path's do not.

## Not modelled yet

- the source of F4, and the meaning of NAS and F2Q (both are placeholders);
- the flag bits b01..b04;
- the glottal pulse shape;
- the noise clock, and the shaper's coefficients;
- the S/H aperture, and clock feedthrough beyond the carrier line;
- power-down and reset details. The A-sheet PD/RST semantics are not assumed for the P die.
